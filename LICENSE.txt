The zlib License, which is listed below
This license is a subset of the other two, and it covers the libjpeg-turbo SIMD extensions.
Complying with the libjpeg-turbo Licenses
This section provides a roll-up of the libjpeg-turbo licensing terms, to the best of our understanding.
1. If you are distributing a modified version of the libjpeg-turbo source, then:
i. You cannot alter or remove any existing copyright or license notices from the source.
Origin
Clause 1 of the IJG License
Clause 1 of the Modified BSD License
Clauses 1 and 3 of the zlib License
ii. You must add your own copyright notice to the header of each source file you modified, so others can tell that you modified that file (if there is not an existing copyright header in that file, then you can simply add a notice stating that you modified the file.)
Origin
Clause 1 of the IJG License
Clause 2 of the zlib License
iii. You must include the IJG README file, and you must not alter any of the copyright or license text in that file.
Origin
Clause 1 of the IJG License
2. If you are distributing only libjpeg-turbo binaries without the source, or if you are distributing an application that statically links with libjpeg-turbo, then:
i. Your product documentation must include a message stating:
This software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group.
Origin
Clause 2 of the IJG license
ii. If your binary distribution includes or uses the TurboJPEG API, then your product documentation must include the text of the Modified BSD License.
Origin
Clause 2 of the Modified BSD License
3. You cannot use the name of the IJG or The libjpeg-turbo Project or the contributors thereof in advertising, publicity, etc.
Origin
i. IJG License
ii. Clause 3 of the Modified BSD License
The IJG and The libjpeg-turbo Project do not warrant libjpeg-turbo to be free of defects, nor do we accept any liability for undesirable consequences resulting from your use of the software.
Origin
i. IJG License
ii. Modified BSD License
iii. zlib License

Permission is granted to anyone to use this software for any purpose, including commercial applications, and to alter it and redistribute it freely, subject to the following restrictions:

2. Altered source versions must be plainly marked as such, and must not be misrepresented as being the original software.
3. This notice may not be removed or altered from any source distribution.
Why Three Licenses?
The zlib License could have been used instead of the Modified (3-clause) BSD License, and since the IJG License effectively subsumes the distribution conditions of the zlib License, this would have effectively placed libjpeg-turbo binary distributions under the IJG License. However, the IJG License specifically refers to the Independent JPEG Group and does not extend attribution and endorsement protections to other entities. Thus, it was desirable to choose a license that granted us the same protections for new code that were granted to the IJG for code derived from their software.

      source, and configuration files.



      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical

      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but

      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,

      and conversions to other media types.



      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or

      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a

      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work

      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).



      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object

      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications

      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes

      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,

      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.



      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of

      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"

      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but

      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."



      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity

      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and

      subsequently incorporated within the Work.



   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable

      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,

      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the

      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.



   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable

      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,

      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a

      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work

      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct

      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses

      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate

      as of the date such litigation is filed.



   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the

      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without

      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You

      meet the following conditions:



      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or

          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and



      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices

          stating that You changed the files; and



      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works

          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and

          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,

          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of

          the Derivative Works; and



      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its

          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must

          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained

          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not

          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one

          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed

          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or

          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,

          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and

          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents

          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and

          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution

          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside

          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided

          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed

          as modifying the License.



      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and

      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions

      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or

      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,

      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with

      the conditions stated in this License.



   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,

      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work

      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of

      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.

      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify

      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed

      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.



   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade

      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor

      and its affiliates, except as required to comply with Section 4(c) of

      the License and to reproduce the content of the NOTICE file.



   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or

      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each

      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,

      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or

      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions

      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A

      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the

      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any

      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.



   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,

      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,

      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly

      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be

      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,

      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a

      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,

      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all

      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor

      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.



   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing

      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,

      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,

      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this

      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only

      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf

      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,

      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability

      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason

      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

END OF COPYRIGHT NOTICE, DISCLAIMER, and LICENSE.

TRADEMARK:

The name "libpng" has not been registered by the Copyright owner
as a trademark in any jurisdiction.  However, because libpng has
been distributed and maintained world-wide, continually since 1995,
the Copyright owner claims "common-law trademark protection" in any
jurisdiction where common-law trademark is recognized.

OSI CERTIFICATION:

Libpng is OSI Certified Open Source Software.  OSI Certified Open Source is
a certification mark of the Open Source Initiative. OSI has not addressed
the additional disclaimers inserted at version 1.0.7.

EXPORT CONTROL:

The Copyright owner believes that the Export Control Classification
Number (ECCN) for libpng is EAR99, which means not subject to export
controls or International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) because
it is open source, publicly available software, that does not contain
any encryption software.  See the EAR, paragraphs 734.3(b)(3) and
734.7(b).

Silicon Graphics has seen fit to allow us to give this work away.  It is free.  There is no support or guarantee of any sort as to its operations, correctness, or whatever.  If you do anything useful with all or parts of it you need to honor the copyright notices.   I would also be interested in knowing about it and, hopefully, be acknowledged.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical

      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but

      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,

      and conversions to other media types.



      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or

      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a

      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work

      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).



      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object

      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications

      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes

      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,

      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.



      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner

      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of

      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"

      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."



      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity

      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and

      subsequently incorporated within the Work.



   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable

      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,

      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the

      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.



   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable

      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,

      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable

      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their

      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)

      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You

      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a

      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work

      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct

      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses

      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate

      as of the date such litigation is filed.



   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the

      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without

      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You

      meet the following conditions:



      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or

          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and



      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices

          stating that You changed the files; and



      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works

          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and

          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,

          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of

          the Derivative Works; and



      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its

          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must

          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained

          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not

          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one

          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed

          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or

          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,

          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and

          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents

          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and

          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution

          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside

          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided

          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed

          as modifying the License.



      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and

      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions

      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or

      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,

      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with

      the conditions stated in this License.



   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,

      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work

      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of

      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.

      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify

      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed

      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.



   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade

      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor

      and its affiliates, except as required to comply with Section 4(c) of

      the License and to reproduce the content of the NOTICE file.



   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or

      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each

      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,

      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or

      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions

      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A

      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the

      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any

      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.



   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,

      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,

      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly

      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be

      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,

      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a

      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,

      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all

      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor

      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.



   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing

      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,

      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,

      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this

      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only

      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf

      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,

      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability

      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason

      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
