This is a copy of the usdHydra schemas since they have been removed in USD v0.8.5.
Those schemas were used by hdStream and are replaced by the UsdPreviewSurface nodes.

To avoid any name clashing in the futur, they are re-named 
from UsdHydra`<name>` to WalterHdStream`<name>`.

TODO: Upgrade Walter for Maya to use the UsdPreviewSurface nodes.
